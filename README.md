# Ambient-Noughts-And-Crosses-Game
Visual and Auditory twist on the game Noughts And Crosses.
# What I Learnt
GUI basics,File, AudioInputStream ( clip , play), .getSource(), Mouse/Button/KeyListener

Good Combo: For loops ( new button(Integer.toString(i)),add(buttons[i]), addActionListener, setIcon, setVisible, setRolloverIcon,setPressedIcon) 

Iterate twice for 3 in a row pattern checker to save a few lines of code.

123    = 000    = 000  }(++3)*2
000    = 456    = 000  } 
000    = 000    = 789  }

Same principle can used for other patterns. 

# What I learnt Afterwards
Dispose() and restart would be cleaner
spread code to multiple classes
Windows Builder eclipse extension ( more effecient )
